      <h4> The Restaurant Industry Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</h4>  
      <ul>

                with an insightful view of the state of the restaurant industry in the U.S.</li>
                <li> Performed data cleaning, plotted graphs using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and created metrics such as the week-over-week percentage change

            <h4> Hydropower Generators in the U.S.</h4>
            <ul><li> Used U.S. hydropower generator data to build decision tree models and random forests, with an accuracy of 93% and 95%
respectively, to predict if a generator was retired and determine whether the Hydro infrastructure in the U.S. is worth renovating. </li>
